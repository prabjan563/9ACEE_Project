            NSET, or the <strong>Society for Earthquake Technology – Nepal</strong> , is a leading non-profit and non-governmental organization established in 1993 with the mission of building a safer and more resilient Nepal. Since its inception, NSET has been working extensively to reduce earthquake risk and promote a culture of disaster preparedness across the country. Over the years, its scope has expanded to include multi-hazard risk management, recognizing Nepal’s vulnerability to earthquakes, floods, landslides, fires, and the growing impacts of climate change.
The organization plays a crucial role in helping communities, government bodies, and institutions strengthen their ability to cope with disasters. Its work includes technical support for safer construction practices, capacity-building programs, development of policy frameworks, and implementation of community-based disaster preparedness initiatives. NSET also conducts training for engineers, masons, schools, local governments, and emergency responders, ensuring that disaster risk reduction becomes an integral part of development.
In addition to structural safety, NSET emphasizes public awareness, school safety programs, and earthquake emergency planning, helping communities understand risk and take proactive measures. Through partnerships with international agencies, government institutions, and local stakeholders, NSET continues to advance research, innovation, and practical solutions aimed at minimizing disaster impacts and promoting long-term resilience.
Overall, NSET remains a key organization dedicated to creating disaster-resilient communities in Nepal, ensuring safer living environments and empowering citizens with the knowledge and tools needed to face future hazards.
